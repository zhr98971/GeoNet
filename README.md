For numerical algorithm of the gradient descent method, proceed to `algorithm_4_25.ipynb`. Running the entire notebook should produce the exact same animation in the last cell. 

For animation without running the `.ipynb` file, proceed to `animation_4_25.gif`. 

For those interested in some of the initial drafts of the nets, I have some of the `.ggb` files in the `geogebra` folder.
